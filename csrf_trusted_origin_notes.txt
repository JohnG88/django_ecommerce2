- Make sure to add to CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS and CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS,the urls
    'http://localhost:3000', 
    'http://127.0.0.1:8000'

- Also set fetch urls in frontend as
    'http://localhost:8000/account/csrf'
    'http://loaclhost:8000/account/login'

- These were for login, idk if rest of frontend needs to fetch same way
